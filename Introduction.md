## First
This is a short test for git and github. The intention of this is to:
* Test
* Compare
* Explore

I also want to see how different commands change things:
 
% hello
$ world
^ of data

would this do anything $git$ or if I do the same but with ^git^ or &git&

I am also doing changes here
* list
* headings

### Heading
